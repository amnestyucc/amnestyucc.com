		<span style="font-size: 64px; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif">O</span>ppression, persecution, conflict,
		violence, law – all of which are the
		defining features of the Rohingya crisis. The Rohingya are an ethnic
		minority of Muslims in the Rakhine State of Myanmar that have
		historically been oppressed by the Burmese since their implementation
		of the 1982 Citizenship Law, which denied all of the Rohingya Burmese
		citizenship. As such, they have become one of the largest groups of
		stateless people in the world. The UN Declaration of Human Rights
		dictates that every human being has the right to a nationality and
		therefore, the Rohingya are facing major human rights violations due to
		that. But at the end of the day, what motivated Myanmar into branding
		the Rohingya as outcasts?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Burmese nationalists, like Firebrand Monk Wirathu, who has been
		dubbed “Monk Bin Laden”, frequently find themselves outraged by the
		outside condemnation of the crisis by the United Nations (UN), the
		International Criminal Court (ICC), as well as several other
		non-governmental organizations. Just recently since September 2018,
		the ICC has begun inquiries into the atrocities of the situation. Many
		nationalists see the Rohingya as illegal immigrants or outsiders from
		Bangladesh. However, the Rohingya have had themselves long since
		established in Myanmar, claiming themselves to be indigenous to the
		region. The Burmese government claims for these people to be
		“Bengali” and just not one of them. As such, they determine the
		Rohingya to not be citizens of Myanmar. Oh, nationalism strikes once
		again but in a different time and different place.</div>
