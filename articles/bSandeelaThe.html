			<span style="font-size: 64px; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif">O</span>ppression, persecution, conflict, violence, law – all of which are the
            defining features of the Rohingya crisis. The Rohingya are an ethnic
            minority of Muslims in the Rakhine State of Myanmar that have
            historically been oppressed by the Burmese since their implementation
            of the 1982 Citizenship Law, which denied all of the Rohingya Burmese
            citizenship. As such, they have become one of the largest groups of
            stateless people in the world. The UN Declaration of Human Rights
            dictates that every human being has the right to a nationality and
            therefore, the Rohingya are facing major human rights violations due to
            that. But at the end of the day, what motivated Myanmar into branding
            the Rohingya as outcasts?
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The Burmese nationalists, like Firebrand Monk Wirathu, who has been
            dubbed “Monk Bin Laden”, frequently find themselves outraged by the
            outside condemnation of the crisis by the United Nations (UN), the
            International Criminal Court (ICC), as well as several other
            non-governmental organizations. Just recently since September 2018,
            the ICC has begun inquiries into the atrocities of the situation. Many
            nationalists see the Rohingya as illegal immigrants or outsiders from
            Bangladesh. However, the Rohingya have had themselves long since
            established in Myanmar, claiming themselves to be indigenous to the
            region. The Burmese government claims for these people to be
            “Bengali” and just not one of them. As such, they determine the
            Rohingya to not be citizens of Myanmar. Oh, nationalism strikes once
            again but in a different time and different place.</div>
