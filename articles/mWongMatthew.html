            If you simply connect all the keywords above together, you will find out
that it’s all pointing at one very significant crisis that’s happening right
at this moment. Nine thousand Rohingyas were killed in just one
month, thousands were left homeless, innocent girls were raped and
sexually assaulted. This has been regarded as possibly the most
inhumane genocide since the start of the 21st century. But who are the
Rohingyas and why have they been prosecuted?</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
                The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority in Myanmar's Rakhine
State, thought to number about 1 million people.
Myanmar regards them as illegal immigrants, a view rooted in their
heritage in East Bengal, now called Bangladesh.</div>
         <div class="paragraph">
            Though many Rohingyas have only known life in Myanmar, they are
widely viewed as intruders from across the border.
According to Human Rights Watch, laws discriminate against the
Rohingya, infringing on their freedom of movement, education, and
employment.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            It is the nationalistic, patriotic, and even superior feeling of their own
            race and religion that started this crisis.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Civilization has fought against inequality all the time. From the
Renaissance Era where the Church reigned supreme across the Globe
to the 18th century, where many African Americans were enslaved for
their entire lives, and even to women in the early 20th century, who had
fought hard for years to gain universal suffrage. We can’t decide other’s
identity, but what we can do is treat people equally with respect. 90% of
the Myanmarese demographics are Buddhist believers and less than
6% are Muslims, which can suggest something about why the
Rohingyas are persecuted. Religion is part of many people in South East
Asia’s daily routine</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Traditional and dogmatic countries like Myanmar don’t accept the large
fluctuation of Muslims to the country. In the last century or so, religion
have transformed completely, from a sacred subject that all of us pay
reverence to, to a subject that is utilized by leaders for conspiracy and
political purposes - without being too biased. I think it’s a good topic to
think about--Has religion changed over time? In what ways is religion
utilized in both positive and negative ways?</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            In 1982, when the citizenship passed, 135 ethnic groups were
recognized but, unfortunately, Rohingyas weren’t one of them. I think in
modern society everyone should have equal rights, and we shouldn’t
judge someone by their religion, the color of skin, or race. Instead, we
should judge them by their true character and their ability to lead a life
of purpose in their given circumstance...</div>
