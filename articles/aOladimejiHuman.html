		<span style="font-size: 64px; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif">T</span>he reclaiming of islands in the
		south China sea by China through methods of sand collection, although seems rather peculiar and unharmful, has
		led to multiple internal and external conflict of countries. To understand the reasons for conflict between
		China and other East/South East Asian countries we must first identify the root cause of the problem. Dominance
		over the South China sea has been a long and foresought goal for many Asian countries. The sea is a hub to
		natural resources ranging from oil, natural gas and 10% of the world's fisheries. Oil is estimated to be roughly
		11 billion barrels and natural gas is weighed in at roughly 190 trillion cubic feet. As you may have already
		presumed, these waters are highly prized giving light to the reason why these countries push for acquiring them.
		According to UN laws, each country in the East Asia area all have claims at roughly 200 nautical miles offshore.
		By China placing islands persistently more out to sea, they will technically have claims over the surrounding
		areas. In each of these areas, China has been pushing instalments of militaristic bases blockades as means of
		asserting dominance. As a result, uncalled for acts of human violations have spiked over the last 4 years since
		the inaction of the reclaiming. Of these violations, one, in particular, took place a small cluster of islands
		located roughly in the middle of the south sea called the Spartland islands. These islands, although barely
		inhabited, inhabitants have been subjects to the too progressive in consideration of surrounding East Asian
		countries for years. Inhabitants (of either Chinese or Vietnamese descent) have been reportedly forced into
		random arresting and unjustified acts of internment into custody. Although their numbers are few these Spartland
		inhabitants, a few shares of their rights are still being violated--the right to enjoy your existing home. UN
		officials actively have made almost no regard towards this issue. Countries such as the United States have been
		exercising their use of soft power to prevent conflict between China whilst still symbolic protection to their
		allies. Collectively, both the additive effects of the violations of human rights and the choice of superpowers
		(such as the United States) has led to the global silencing of the Spartland inhabitants.
