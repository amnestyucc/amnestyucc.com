        <span style="font-size: 64px; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif">O</span>n Dec. 24, 2021, the Myanmar
        government shot and burned the bodies of over 30 villagers - including women and children.


    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        This has not been an isolated incident. Since the first genocide from October 2016 to January 2017, the Rohingya
        people have faced ongoing persection. The introduction of a military government (after overthrowing Aung San Suu
        Kyi) has only brought further turmoil to the country. Now, not only are ethnic minorities such as the Muslim
        Rohingya or the Christian-Buddhist Karenni targetted, but the Buddhist Bamar ethnic majority has been subject to
        massacres as well.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        For one, due to the area’s support for the opposition to the government, more than 80 Bamar people were killed
        in the Sagaing region. The massacre in Done Taw, accounted within that number, saw “smoldering corpses in a
        circle in a burned-out hut” with a particular victim burned alive. CTV News came to describe this razing of
        villages as “massacres and scorched-earth tactics”, employed on civilians and opposition alike.

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        NBC News counts the number of civilian deaths to be at least 35 by government soldiers. Martin Griffiths, a U.N.
        undersecretary general, said “I am horrified by reports of an attack against civilians [...] I condemn this
        grievous incident and all attacks against civilians throughout the country, which are prohibited under
        international humanitarian law.” The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also advised stopping the flow of
        weapons to the Myanmar military in order to prevent the “recurrence of atrocities.”

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        Since Dec. 16, 5,000 villagers from Myanmar have fled across a border river to the safety of Thai territory.
        Although we may not be able to address the complicated ethnic and political history of Myanmar, I hope that the
        international community can offer support for these refugees and assist civilians within high-risk regions
        during this difficult time.
