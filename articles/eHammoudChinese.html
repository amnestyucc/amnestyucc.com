		<span style="font-size: 64px; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif">S</span>ince the creation of its republic,
		China has always been scrutinized by the public for its iniquitous policies regarding human rights. Whether it’s
		through politically motivated prosecutions or its failure to adopt gender parity into its society, there have
		been various examples of controversy between Chinese citizens and government. Due to its restricting policies,
		any sentiments expressing revolt have been immediately suppressed by its government using any means necessary.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Earlier this year, the government of Hong Kong proposed a bill that would permit the extradition of suspects
		from Hong Kong to mainland China. Although the bill has since been withdrawn, the violence and protests ensue.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lately, following the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law, as well as the suspension of the extradition
		bill, the Chinese people seem to be displeased with their authoritative regime. In fact, they have been leading
		a series of large scale revolts and protests expressing their deep disapproval for the harsh policies limiting
		their technological freedom. Examples of these include the restriction of privileges like social media sites
		(i.e. Instagram and twitter), or the invasion of privacy which vis à vis the cybersecurity law. These revolts
		have further captured the public’s attention, and many of them have made it to the front page of prominent
		newspapers such as the New York Times. Unlike the Umbrella movement in 2014, these protests have no leader and
		have not yet managed to channel their anger into more peaceful means of achieving their goal like public
		speakers. Instead, they have resulted to more violent actions to obtain their most desired rights.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Unfortunately, these violent rebellions have resulted in the desecration of properties and the exacerbation of
		relations with the government. But if history has shown us anything, it is that in order for change to occur,
		strong and influential action must be taken - just like the driven people of China are taking now.
