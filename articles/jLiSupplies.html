	<div class="paragraph">
		<span style="font-size: 64px; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif">A</span>s death rates skyrocket in the
		familiar, democratic countries around us, it becomes easy to overlook the impact of COVID-19 outside of the
		western bubble. Specifically, for countries where sanctions have crippled the national economy for years even
		before the crisis, a continued imposition of these policies could spell mass hunger and contagion during a
		critical time.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Unilateral sanctions already inflict severe economic consequences in vulnerable countries - including Syria,
		Venezuela, Iran and Cuba. Many, however, fear a further progression into complete famine as employment
		opportunities become rarer and rarer. This is largely due to an impoverished population that is unfairly denied
		from foreign food aid as large trade tariffs substantially mark up the price of these products, disregarding the
		people’s fundamental right to sufficient and adequate food. In fact, WFP director David Beasley notes that the
		current trend could lead to a worst case scenario of some three dozen countries trapped in a “hunger pandemic”.
		Many UN officials have voiced their support for lifting international food sanctions in hopes of ensuring enough
		food supplies reach hungry populations during the COVID-19 crisis.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		More imminently, however, is the demand for essential medicines and medical equipment that are impeded by strict
		international export constraints. Take Iran for instance, where the infected count rises by almost fifty every
		hour, and the death count by one every 10 minutes (as of March 19th). These alarming rates come largely as a
		result of a lack of medical supplies to support the country's debilitated healthcare infrastructure - which in
		turn is caused by a combination of weak purchasing powers (due to depreciating Iranian currency) and
		underfinanced humanitarian imports (due to, again, the sanctions). Even exemptions - designed specifically to
		allow for humanitarian aid in times like these - are largely ineffective in practice. For one, Human Rights
		Watch found that these exemptions have “failed to offset the strong reluctance of US and European companies and
		banks to risk incurring sanctions [...] by exporting or financing exempted humanitarian goods.” Systemic issues
		with mandatory licensing for these goods have also plagued the process - general licenses are capped at $500,000
		and excludes certain supplies that are crucial to fighting the virus (e.g. decontamination equipment, full-mask
		respirators), while special licenses that do grant access to these supplies have an acceptance rate of a mere
		10% under the Trump administration. In all, if drastic changes to international sanctions are not influenced
		soon, the western hemisphere would only be guilty of compounding these countries’ agony by “depriving them of
		access to the critical medical resources they urgently need”.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sanctions have long been used to address authoritarian regimes that threaten the peace and security of the
		international community, but its true effects could be perverse to the expected. As the upholders of human
		rights, it is our responsibility - and particularly so during this unforeseen crisis - to ensure that it is not
		the civilians who suffer from these broader consequences. And we can only do so with a thorough re-envisioning
		on the role of sanctions to protect the accessibility to crucial food and medicine for the most vulnerable.
