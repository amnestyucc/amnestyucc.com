	<div class="paragraph">
		<span style="font-size: 64px; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif">R</span>iots, month-long protests, and
		outbreaks of violence. It seems as if rampage and chaos are the only constants in Hong Kong, as the local
		citizens are facing violent restrictions on their right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Earlier this year, the government of Hong Kong proposed a bill that would permit the extradition of suspects
		from Hong Kong to mainland China. Although the bill has since been withdrawn, the violence and protests ensue.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is likely because the bill is representative of a much deeper, underlying issue. The tense relationship
		between the two regions has existed since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to mainland China under the ‘one
		country, two systems’ principle.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And ever since then, China has made several attempts to erode the autonomy of the region, ultimately returning
		authority to the mainland.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Article 4 of the Basic Law in post-colonial Hong Kong states that the mainland must safeguard the rights and
		freedoms of the residents of Hong Kong. Despite this, researchers have documented the unnecessary and excessive
		use of force, including the employment of tear gas, batons and other weapons used by police on the largely
		peaceful protesters. Moreover, the police have applied vague charges to arrest and prosecute thousands of
		peaceful protesters.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With these incidents occurring more and more frequently, a peaceful resolution is seeming to be less and less
		likely. As such, we must encourage the authorities to find a diplomatic solution sooner rather than later.
