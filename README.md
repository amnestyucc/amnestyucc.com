# AmnestyUCC

Welcome to the Amnesty UCC repo :)

We have a very standard setup because it's a pretty simple site -- It's made with plain HTML/CSS + JS.

The site is hosted with github pages and AWS Route53. If you happen to have issues with deployment, try to get in contact with Ibrahim Fadel, as the it's hosted on his AWS account. Github: IbrahimFadel, Email: ibrahim.m.fadel@gmail.com
