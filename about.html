		<p style="font-size: 16px">In 1961, two Portuguese students were imprisoned for raising a toast to freedom.
			Peter Benenson, a vigilant British lawyer, sparked conversation and action around the world about the issue
			through an article he published in the Observer. In Benenson&apos;s initiative, the organization Amnesty
			International was born.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">Since Amnesty&apos;s beginning, the organization has been driven to protect human
			rights around the world. By investigating and revealing facts about violations, lobbying governments and
			large corporations, and mobilizing millions around the world to take a stand for change, Amnesty strives to
			support individuals in and/or out of power.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">Through the collective effort of organizers to civilian supporters, Amnesty has had
			many successes. In 1963, Amnesty released Ukrainian Archbishop Josyf Slipyi, a prisoner of conscience in
			Siberia through protest. In 1972, Amnesty launched it&apos;s first campaign against torture, which was later
			adopted by the United Nations. Finally, Amnesty was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">&quot;Only when the last prisoner of conscience has been freed, when the last torture
			chamber has been closed, when the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a reality for the
			world&apos;s people, will our work be done.&quot; - Peter Benenson, Amnesty International founder</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">The Amnesty International Club at Upper Canada College aims to...</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 80px">1. Raise awareness and educate about humanitarian issues</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 80px">2. Promote and encourage action from the community</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 80px">3. Create a space for meaningful discussion about human rights</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">If you&apos;re interested in joining the club or even just writing articles for our
			publications, feel free to join the club on Managebac/Brightspace.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 16px">Thanks for your time!</p>
